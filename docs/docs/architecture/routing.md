title: Routing
---

The routing is managed by [React Router][1].

The routing is split in two cases:
- Main panel
- Windowed panels

The Main panel is the view that occupy the entire screen, while the Windowed panels are 
shown in an area which occupy a portion of the screen and is over the Main Panel

The url of an app must start with the `/app/app_package_name/` prefix.
