title: Zextras Shell
---

The core of the Zextras Mail project.

The designs are created using [Pencil][1] and the project file is [assets/design/Shell.epgz][2]

## Goals

The goal of the Zextras project is to create a framework to easily create extension to implement the features of a product.

Zextras shell will only handle the login process and the loading of the extensions once the login process is done by the user.
Zextras itself will also provide a graphical placement of the extensions loaded and share some commons packages with the extensions.
