If You need to develop on the shell while You are developing on another app,
You can build the Shell and replace the content of the `node_modules/@zextras/zapp-shell/` folder.

To achieve this result You can simply run this command:
```shell script
PKG_PATH=<YOUR PACKAGE PATH HERE> npm run deploy
```
